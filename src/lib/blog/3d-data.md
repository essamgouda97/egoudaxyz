Since *vibe coding* is now a well-established term, I decided to try it on another form of data. I've worked extensively with images, audio, and text, but I had never trained a network on 3D models. Our life exists in 3D, so it only makes sense to understand how to work with 3D data. 🫡

## Task: Train a Model That’s Good at Embedding 3D Models

I started with the [ModelNet10 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/modelnet10-princeton-3d-object-dataset/data) and implemented [PointNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593), a straightforward neural network that accepts unstructured point data and is suitable for classification and segmentation tasks. However, what I really wanted was **"3D models → embeddings"** (fancy term for *a list of numbers that helps computers represent stuff*). These embeddings are stored in PointNet’s global feature layer (marked green).

## Data

First off, the data comes in `.off` files, a format that represents faces and vertices in a human-readable way. Thanks to this [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/balraj98/pointnet-for-3d-object-classification-pytorch/notebook), I was able to borrow some code to read the data. In summary:

- **Faces & Vertices:** A vertex is a point in 3D space, and a face is the shape created when those points are connected.
- **Mesh:** A structured shape, e.g., a **Triangular Mesh** (a face that looks like a triangle). Below is a **visual representation** of a bathtub read from a `.off` file:

- Once we have the meshes, we need to **sample** them. Since I’m using PointNet, I sample the mesh into **points!**

## Self-Supervised Training with NT-Xent Loss

In the real world, **data is unlabeled** cuz humans are messy. To try and mimic the real world I picked NT-Xent Loss that is usually used in a self-supervised way.

### What is NT-Xent Loss?

NT-Xent stands for **Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross Entropy Loss**, and it’s a key component in **contrastive learning**. It helps the model learn **meaningful representations** by ensuring that similar data points (positive pairs) have embeddings that are close together, while dissimilar ones (negative pairs) are pushed apart.

### Adding an MLP Head for the Loss

To improve contrastive learning performance, I added an **MLP head** on top of the **global feature layer** of PointNet. This MLP head consists of:

- A **512-dimensional dense layer** with **BatchNorm** and **ReLU** activation.
- A **final projection layer** that maps embeddings to the space used for NT-Xent Loss.

This **projection step is crucial** because:

1. It **improves the separation** between embeddings before computing the loss.
2. It **prevents the network from collapsing** into trivial embeddings.
3. It **learns a better metric space**, making embeddings more robust for similarity comparisons.

### How Does It Work?

1. **Data Pairing Using Labels:**
   - The *anchor* and *positive* come from the same class.
   - The *negative* comes from a different class.

2. **Embedding Similarity:**
   - The MLP head processes embeddings before similarity computation.
   - We compute the **cosine similarity** between all embeddings in a batch.
   - The similarity scores are scaled using a **temperature parameter (τ)**, which controls how much we want to separate positive pairs from negative pairs.

3. **Contrastive Loss Calculation:**
   - The loss function ensures that the similarity between *positive pairs* is maximized, while the similarity with *negative pairs* is minimized:

   $$
   L = -\log \frac{\exp(sim(z_i, z_j)/\tau)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N} \exp(sim(z_i, z_k)/\tau)}
   $$

### How I Selected Positive and Negative Samples

I **cheated** and used the class labels to construct *positive*, *negative*, and *anchor* samples instead of relying on augmentations.

Since the dataset is labeled, I leveraged the existing class labels for contrastive learning:

- **Anchor:** A randomly chosen 3D model from a specific class.
- **Positive:** Another sample from the same class.
- **Negative:** A sample from a different class.

If the dataset were **unlabeled**, I would have needed to:

1. Augment the same sample to create positives.
2. Select a random 3D model as a negative.
3. Ensure negatives were not too similar to the anchor by using feature distance constraints.

## Evaluation

### Loss Curve

Although the **training and test loss have been decreasing**, meaning the model is **learning**, the embeddings do not yet form **distinct clusters**. Ideally, classes should be well-separated, but the visualizations show overlap. Anyways good enough for the weekend and a nice intro to 3D data.

*Figure 5: UMAP visualization of learned embeddings at epoch 100, showing class overlap.*

### Possible Reasons

1. **Temperature Parameter (τ)**
   - If τ is too high, the contrastive loss becomes weak, and embeddings might not separate well.
   - If τ is too low, the loss becomes too strict, causing the model to collapse.

2. **Insufficient Hard Negatives**
   - If negative samples are too easy, the model does not learn to separate classes well.
   - A better approach would be to implement **hard negative mining**, selecting **negatives closer to the anchor** instead of random negatives.

3. **Lack of Strong Augmentations**
   - Augmentations could introduce more variability in positive samples, forcing the model to generalize better.
   - Techniques like **random rotations, noise injection, and jittering** might help improve the model’s robustness.

4. **Projection Head Might Be Too Shallow**
   - A deeper **MLP projection head** could improve feature learning.
   - A **wider embedding space** (e.g., 256-dimensional embeddings instead of 128) could enhance separation.

## Next Steps

- **Tune temperature (τ)** to find a better balance between positive and negative similarity.
- **Improve negative selection** by integrating **hard negative mining** instead of picking random negatives.
- **Enhance augmentation pipeline** to encourage better generalization.
- **Test a deeper MLP projection head** to improve the separation of embeddings.

## Shoutout to

- My **Kaggle** and **Hugging Face** homies
- **ChatGPT** and **Cursor**
- **Math** for being awesome and keeping it real

## Challenges and Roadmap

- I want to use a **better dataset**—finding a reliable 3D dataset is difficult. I requested access to [PartNet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ShapeNet/PartNet-archive) on Hugging Face and somehow got it. Any suggestions for other datasets?
- Can I use **better loss functions**? I'm thinking about experimenting with **Triplet Loss** and **Barlow Twins Loss** to see if they improve embedding quality.
- Next, I want to **populate a vector database** (FAISS or Milvus) and perform searches on it.
- Is there a **better architecture**? A **better representation** of 3D models other than point clouds? Maybe try **PointNet++ or a Transformer-based model?**

More to come. Cheers 🥂
