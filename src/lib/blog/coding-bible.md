This article will be updated as I find more rules that helped me in my coding journey. Below are the coding practices and principles that I follow.

## 1. Hooks = readable code

Good hooks lead to clean and readable code.

## 2. Code the task immediately, debug later

Start coding the task without worrying too much about perfection. Debugging comes afterward.

## 3. Tests, Tests, Tests

Testing is vital for maintaining code quality and ensuring stability.

## 4. Proper debugging skills are a must to understand any codebase

A solid understanding of debugging will help you comprehend and fix issues within any codebase.

## 5. Define happy paths in your flow

Ensure you have a clear, happy path defined in your code flow for expected behavior.

## 6. New work rules

   1. Meet as many people as possible. Ask them what they do, what issues they are facing (technical and non-technical), and what they plan to work on next.
   2. Understand the organizational chart.
   3. Draw an end-to-end flow for everything you plan to touch.
   4. Do an end-to-end run with a debugger.

## 7. Sketch high-level, then iterate between low-level designs and coding

Start with high-level designs and then move to detailed designs, iterating between design and coding.

## 8. Rollbacks must be smooth

Ensure your rollback processes are simple and smooth to avoid headaches.

## 9. Follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/) `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (XX.XX.XX)`

   1. **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes.
   2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward-compatible manner.
   3. **PATCH** version when you make backward-compatible bug fixes.

## 10. `{FUNCTION-SERVICE}_ENVVARNAME` for env vars e.g., `REDIS_HOST`.

Always use clear and consistent naming for environment variables, following a predictable structure.

## 11. Low level whenever you can. The less abstractions (especially initially) the better

Avoid excessive abstractions in the beginning. Focus on simplicity and clarity.

## 12. Instead of doing destructive actions directly, implement a simulation mode

If the simulation mode is active, log the action in an SQLite database instead of deleting anything.

## 13. Dependency injection. Functional programming. (Take in progress)

Make use of dependency injection and incorporate functional programming principles where possible.

## 14. CONSISTENT NAMING CONVENTIONS FOR LIFE!

Stick to a consistent naming convention for all your variables, functions, and services.

## 15. Delays aren’t always a bad thing, especially with many requests to a service

In cases of multiple requests to a service, delays might actually help with load balancing and reliability.

## 16. Less assumptions, more debugging

Don't assume what's wrong. Debug it.

## 17. No one really likes `yamls`

YAMLs can get messy quickly. Use them with care and avoid unnecessary complexity.

## 18. Never clean up at once (unless it's a quick cleanup, of course)

Start cleaning up iteratively, piece by piece, to avoid large-scale disruptions.

## 19. Understand the git graph

You need to be able to navigate commits like a time traveler:  
`git log --reverse --oneline <starting-commit-hash>..main`

## 20. Understand allocated memory vs resident memory vs phantom memory

Allocated memory is the memory that has been allocated by the program might be in RAM or disk (swap). Resident memory is the memory that is currently in RAM. Phantom memory is the memory that is not currently in RAM, but is still allocated by the program. [Nice article](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/measuring-memory-python/)

## 21. Small changes > Big changes

Small changes are easier to reason about, test, review and debug. Specifically in ML pipeline, ideally you only change a config file. [Nice read for ML pipelines](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09125)


## 22. Always return exit codes

Your script should handle exit codes properly.
